Installation of signature is easy. Just do:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

I'm just starting to get the hang of autoconf, automake and autoheader,
so I could probably have done certain things more easily and added other
useful checks. Bear with me; these things take time.

Once the program is installed, create a signature template (see the man
page for details) called, say ~/signature, and then run signature as
follows:

    signature -t ~/signature

You might like to put this command in your ~/.bash_profile or similar
start-up script for the greatest ease of use.

If you've compiled your own collection of pithy sayings, you might
prefer to compile a quote file and start signature like this:

    signature -t ~/signature -q ~/quote_file

If you don't like fortune cookies, you may prefer something like this:

    signature -t ~/signature -p uptime

which will add system uptime information to your signature.
