	* format.c: fixed bug that caused '<' placeholder to remain behind
	  when there were backspaces or underscores in the text

Sun Jul  2 18:01:27 EDT 2000  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: fixed bug that caused FIFO and quote file not to be
	  found when using -f and -q options

	* signature.c: added a couple of debugging messages

	* format.c: white space now trimmed from the end of sig lines

	* format.c: ^H (backspace) and _ now ignored in fortune output

	* signature.1: added bug that % in fortune text may be
	  misinterpreted as printf(3) format specifier

Sun Apr 16 16:06:16 PDT 2000  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c signature.h: Pine fails to play properly with
	  signature, because an fstat(2) on the FIFO prior to opening it
	  returns 0 in stat.st_size, causing Pine to open and close it
	  without actually reading anything. The resulting SIGPIPE is now
	  ignored using ignore_sigpipe(). It doesn't make signature work
	  with Pine, but it at least stops the program from exiting.

	* signature.1: updated to reflect the fact that Pine is broken
	  with respect to FIFO signatures
	
Sun Feb 13 23:47:24 CET 2000  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: external programs can now be called with arguments
	  (shell quoting required). The code for this was adapted from a
	  patch supplied by Bob Salnick <salnick@salnick.cac.washington.edu>

	* quote.c: quote files can now use either ~ or % as a separator

	* signature.1: changes to reflect the above

Thu Dec 30 01:19:23 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: moved uname() code to format.c

	* format.c: return code check of uname() now checks for == -1
	  instead of != 0, since a positive integer also indicates success
	  on Solaris.

	* signature.c format.c quote.c: not all fatal errors caused
	  FIFO to be cleared up on exit. Fixed.

	* signature.1: DIAGNOSTICS section removed. Most of the error
	  messages issued by signature are self-explanatory.

Wed Dec 29 01:19:06 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: -d for no-daemon mode is now -n

	* signature.c: -d now provides debugging output on stderr

	* signature.c: caught_signal() added

	* signature.c: del_fifo() renamed unlink_fifo()

	* signature.c: signal handler installation moved from init_fifo()
	  to its own function: install_sig_handler()

	* format.c format.h: broke out format_sig() into its own 
	  source files

	* quote.c quote.h: new source files for quote file functions

	* Makefile.am: use CFLAGS, not DEFS, for compiler warning
	  switches

	* acconfig.h: new file for use with autoheader. This gives us
	  config.h.in, which autoconf processes to give us config.h.
	  This file contains defines, so that they no longer have to
	  be supplied to the compiler on the command line in @DEFS@

	* signature.1: updated with information about quote files

Mon Dec 27 17:01:50 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.h: put function prototypes into a header file

Sun Dec 26 19:27:50 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: daemon mode made more daemon-like

	* Makefile.am: build environment now uses GNU automake

	* configure.in signature.c: check for availability of
	  offensive fortunes (Red Hat doesn't use them by default)

Mon Dec 20 23:13:34 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: signature now forks into background on
	  start-up. The -d switch has been added to prevent this
	  for debugging purposes.

	* signature.1: changes to reflect the above

Mon Dec 13 00:40:32 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: when supplying an alternative program to fortune
	  with the -p switch, the full path no longer has to be
	  provided. We now check for the existence of the given program
	  by forking and trying to exec it in the child.

	* signature.1: minor modification to reflect the above change

	* signature.c: usage message omitted -f in option list

Sun Nov 21 12:22:07 CET 1999  Jarmo Pussinen <pussinen@saunalahti.fi>

	* signature.c: default sig format string changed for kernel
	  and architecture strings of different lengths

Mon Nov  8 12:05:51 CET 1999  Ian Macdonald  <ian@caliban.org>

	* signature.c: call to waitpid() added to stop child processes
	  becoming zombies (sigh, it's not easy being a beginner)

	* signature.c: usage message tidied up
